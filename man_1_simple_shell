.SH DESCRIPTION

.B hsh

is a basic imitation of a command line interpreter that reads and implements basic commands from user input as a shell would.

.PP

.B hsh

 is compiled on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS with gcc 4.8.4 (C90). It is built to run in both interactive and noninteractive mode.

.PP

.SH USER INPUT

Once a user inputs a command and hits enter, the shell performs the following actions:



1. Splits the command into an array of words.



2. Looks for the command.



3. Executes the command.

.PP

.SH SEARCH FOR COMMAND

When locating a command, the shell looks for a built-in command by that name.

If a built-in command is not found, the shell searches for the command in the PATH.

.PP

.SH EXECUTE COMMAND

Commands are executed in a child process of the main process.

.PP

.SH BUILTINS

.IP env

Prints out all environment variables

.IP exit

Exits process and frees memory allocated.

.PP

.SH BUGS

There are memory leaks when exiting the shell.

This will be fixed in a later version of this shell.
